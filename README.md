# WordFSorter

Output is words in ascending order sorted by the fraction of vowel letters in each word.
For input you may place your text in the text.txt file. 
Words will be separated by space, comma, dot, all kind of brackets and other symbols that are usually seen as dividing.
I made restriction that each word shouldn`t be longer that 30smb so if it`s longer it will be shortened to 30smb.
Words that are repeated in text will be outputed only 1 time. If it`s original word and shortened this rule is also working.

My text.txt file contains "words" for all type of checks.
